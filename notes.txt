Ok now I want to create a controller that simply checks if a particular playerId is already present in scoreData.json.

It will be called: PlayerExistenceController

It will generally be called BEFORE ScoreController so it should be able to read scoreData.json and
extract all playerId's (the key's in our json) and use them to populate an arraylist which will
then be used to check if the supplied playerId already exists or not.

I am asuming I will need to setup a two methods:
one for the Getrequest (@Getmapping) and
one for reading the data from file (@Postconstruct) similar to out ScoreController class?
